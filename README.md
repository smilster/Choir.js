## What is Choir.js
**Choir.js** is a client-side JavaScript tool designed for **inspiration** and **education**. The core feature is the **automatic note generation**, e.g., useful for adding a voice to a small musical passage.

Choir.js itself **does not understand** chord progression or harmony. Instead, a good melody already encodes chord progression to some extent, though not in a unique way. By defining scales and vertical interval-relations between voices (and the addition of randomness), Choir.js is capable of producing numerous harmonizing versions (or disharmonizing if you prefer). **It's your job** to figure out how to tweak scales and intervals such that you have a pleasing musical passage. You decide if it sounds good or not; **you are the composer**, and Choir.js is only your little inspiring assistant.

### You can begin in several ways
- Define a musical scale/mode and generate a random melody.
- Input your own melody.
- Input the root notes of a chord progression.

Finally: Add more voices, refine inter-voice relations, change instruments, adjust volume and panning, change playback speed, experiment with scales, and learn how all of this impacts the perception of harmony and musical expression. 

Inspect the `Notegenerator.js` if you are interested in the core algorithm for note generation.

## What it's not
It's not a DAW. It's not a fancy live performance looping gadget. It's not a music notation software. It's not an AI black box for music generation.
